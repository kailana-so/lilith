    "content": "Apples are generally rounder and firmer with a thinner skin, while pears are often bell-shaped with a softer, grainy texture and thicker skin. Apples grow on trees of the genus *Malus*, whereas pears come from trees of the genus *Pyrus*. Flavor-wise, pears tend to be sweeter and milder compared to the tartness common in many apples.\n\nSources: USDA, Royal Horticultural Society."
